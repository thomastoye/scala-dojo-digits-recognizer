Scala Dojo "Digits Recognizer"
==============================

This is a Scala port of [Mathias Brandewinder's F# digit recognizer dojo](https://github.com/c4fsharp/Dojo-Digits-Recognizer)

This Dojo is inspired by the [Kaggle Digit Recognizer contest](http://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer).
The goal is to write a **Machine Learning** classifier from scratch, a program that will recognize hand-written digits automatically.
It is a guided Dojo, **suitable for beginners**: the Dojo comes with a Script file, with specific tasks to complete, introducing along the way numerous Scala concepts and syntax examples.
The Dojo is on the longer side; for a group with limited Scala experience, it is recommended to **schedule it for 2 hours and a half**.
